## My Top Recommendation for Thursday, December 26th at 10am:

**CHEEKY'S** or **FARM** - Both are definitely open and serving breakfast/brunch at 10am on Thursday. These are your only guaranteed options for true brunch service on a weekday morning.

**Strategy:** Arrive by 9:45am to either location (both are walk-in only). Since it's the day after Christmas, expect holiday visitors and potential waits.

- Choose **Cheeky's** for: Creative, rotating menu; MICHELIN recognition; famous Bacon Flight
- Choose **FARM** for: French courtyard ambiance; authentic crepes; romantic setting

**Important:** December 26th is the day after Christmas. While these establishments should be operating on regular hours, it's wise to call ahead to confirm, especially for holiday schedules.
